This folder contains some examples of a small artistic brainchild of mine. 
The core function is the spire function which takes a triangle and fills it with a cool spiral pattern. This can then be applied to any set of triangles, and in particular is implemented to arbitrary triangulations of any shapes (implemented with Darren Engwirda's Mesh2D MATLAB functions, also included).
